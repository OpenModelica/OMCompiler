OPC DA Runtime Library
======================

OPC DA is an older version of OPC than OPC UA, which uses Windows COM
for communication. It does not run on Linux, like OPC UA. This code
uses OPCKit.dll. See the OpenModelica documentation and OMDev for the
binaries. That code is not open source; its license allows distribution
with OpenModelica.
